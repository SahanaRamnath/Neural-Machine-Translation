# Neural-Machine-Translation
Implementing NMT on an IWSLT dataset, using sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, in Tensorflow 
# Dependencies
* Libraries tensorflow,collections,os,time,collections,random,numpy and codecs in python 2.x

# Codes

# Dataset Used
English-Vietnamese parallel corpus of TED Talks, provided by the [IWSLT Evaluation Campaign](https://sites.google.com/site/iwsltevaluation2015/).
Preprocessed data from [The Stanford NLP group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt/) was used to train and test the models.
